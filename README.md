# Personal Website

My personal website that does not uses a framework or library. My old website was too bad so this is the rewritten version.

## Customizing

If you want to fork my website and add your discord profile, You can do this easily. Fork the website and open `./static/js/app.js` file. Replace all `793467584820281346` with your Discord ID. Don't forget to join Lanyard server before doing this.

## Note
The difference between `./static/js/app.js` and `./static/js/app_es6.js` is `app.js` is compiled to `ES5` but `app_es6.js` is not.
